# repo status
[![Build Hub](https://github.com/smellofair/rules-hub/actions/workflows/build-hub.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/smellofair/rules-hub/actions/workflows/build-hub.yml)

# next steps

## todo
- fully functional pipeline (minus "pretty")
- add repository language settings into `rules-hub` instead of `rules-lang-${LANG}`
- restrict token permissions?

## done
- ✅ make public
- ✅ set up github pages link
    - It should be [here](https://smellofair.github.io/rules-hub/)?
    - if the pipeline isn't working yet, then check [here](https://smellofair.github.io/rules-hub/status.md)
- ✅ make the `en` extraction more smarter (i.e. don't assume `rules-lang-en` maybe it's gonna be `rules-frosthaven-is-the-best`)
    - i'll just use the repo name, so `smellofair/rules-lang-en` becomes `translations/rules-lang-en`
