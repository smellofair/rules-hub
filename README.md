# next steps 

- fully functional pipeline (minus "pretty")
- make public
- set up github pages link
- add repository language settings into `rules-hub` instead of `rules-lang-${LANG}`
- make the `en` extraction more smarter (i.e. don't assume `rules-lang-en` maybe it's gonna be `rules-frosthaven-is-the-best`)
- restrict token permissions?
